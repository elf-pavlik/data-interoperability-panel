### Discovery Result ### {#sec-ard-result}


#### Successful Results #### {#sec-ard-result-success}

In case the response of the [=Agent Manager=] had status code [S200], the
response body is [=RDF Document=] representing the [=Agent Registration=], which
the [=Agent=] [MAY] parse. The source URL of the [=Agent Registration=] is the
value of the [:Content-Location:] header.

In case the response of the [=Agent Manager=] had status code [S303], the [:Location:] header contains the source URL of the [=Agent
Registration=], which the [=Agent=] [MAY] retrieve using a [:GET:] request.


#### Error Results #### {#sec-ard-result-error}

In case the response of the [=Agent Manager=] had status code 
[S400] or [S401], the [=Agent=] [SHOULD] make 
sure that its request includes an [:Authorization:] header, with the scheme set
to [:DPoP:], and the value is a valid [[DPOP]]-bound [=Identity Token=] that
authenticates the [=Agent=] itself. If it is able to construct such a request,
the [=Agent=] [MAY] retry to get its [=Agent Registration=] from the [=Agent
Manager=].

In case the response of the [=Agent Manager=] had status code [S403], the [=Agent=] [SHOULD] take the [=Resources=] discoverable from
the [=Entity's=] [=Identity Document=] to contain the only information 
immediately available, i.e. the [=Agent=] [SHOULD] act as if it had received a
response with status code [S303] with the [HTTP] [:Location:] 
header set to the URL of the [=Entity's=] [=Identity Document=].
