Authorization Flows {#authorization}
=====================

Authorization represents several key elements that
work together to grant, adjust, and rescind access to data controlled
by a [=Social Agent=].

Key authorization flows are facilitated by an [=Authorization Agent=]
on behalf of a [=Social Agent=].

<table class="data tree" align="left">

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flow</th>
      <th>Scenario</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Application Requests Access</b></td>
      <td>A [=Social Agent=] elects to use a new
        [=Application=]. The [=Application=] prompts the
        [=Social Agent=] for access to data in their control.
        [=Access Needs=] are provided by the [=Application=].
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Another Social Agent Requests Access</b></td>
      <td>A [=Social Agent=] requests access to data owned
        by another [=Social Agent=]. [=Access Needs=] are provided
        in an [=Access Request=]. Resultant notification is
        provided through an [=Access Receipt=].</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Social Agent Shares Access</b></td>
      <td>A [=Social Agent=] using an [=Application=] elects to share
        access to data in their control with another [=Social Agent=]
        that did not request it. [=Access Needs=] are provided by
        [=Application=]. Notification that access was shared is provided
        through an [=Access Receipt=].</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="assertion">

<b>Each authorization flow listed above uses the following pattern:</b>

1. A requesting [=Agent=] expresses
    their [[#needs|Access Needs]] to a given [=Social Agent=] for data in their control.
2. [[#needs|Access Needs]] are processed and presented to the [=Social Agent=]
    by their [=Authorization Agent=].
3.  The [=Social Agent's=] access decisions are captured and enacted
    through [[#authorizations]].
4.  The requesting [=Agent=] looks for an [=Access Grant=]
    stored in a corresponding [=Agent Registration=] in the [=Agent Registry=] of the
    data owner. This [=Access Grant=] tells them exactly what they have access to.

</div>

Slight variations concerning where [=Access Needs=] are sourced from, and
how notification of access is provided, are the only differences from
one flow to another.

## Authorization Agent ## {#authorization-agent}

An <dfn>Authorization Agent</dfn> is an [=Application=] designated by
a [=Social Agent=] to be responsible for managing the access to data
under their control, linked via their [=Registry Set=].
It is an implementation of an **Agent Manager** as defined by the 
[[sai-am|Agent Management]] specification.

Any requests for access to the [=Social Agent=]
are processed by the [=Authorization Agent=].
Similarly, any decisions by the [=Social Agent=] to share data with another [=Agent=]
are processed by the [=Authorization Agent=].

### Authorization Agent Discovery ### {#authorization-agent-discovery}

This document extends the [Agent Manager Discovery](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/agent-management/index.html#sec-am-discovery) of the [[sai-am|Agent Manager]] specification,
by defining `interop:hasAuthorizationAgent` as subproperty of `interop:hasAccessManager`.
the [=Authorization Agent=] for a given [=Social Agent=] can be discovered

The [=Authorization Agent=] for a given [=Social Agent=] can be discovered
by de-referencing the [=identity=] of that [=Social Agent=], and extracting
the object value of the `interop:hasAuthorizationAgent` statement from the
returned [=identity profile document=],
or the corresponding `Link` header in the response.

### Agent Registration Discovery ### {#agent-registration-discovery}

An [=Agent=] that needs to discover whether a target [=Social Agent=] has
a corresponding [=Agent Registration=] for them can query the
[=Authorization Agent=] for that target [=Social Agent=].

As described in the section on [Agent Registration Discovery](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/agent-management/index.html#sec-ar-discovery) of the [[sai-am|Agent Manager]] specification,
To discover a corresponding [=Agent Registration=] the requesting [=Agent=]
may perform an `HTTP HEAD` or `HTTP GET` request on the IRI of the
[=Authorization Agent=] for the target [=Social Agent=].

The response will include an `HTTP Location`, 
`HTTP Content-Location`, or `HTTP Link` header 
with the `http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/interop#registeredAgent` link relation,
relating the [=Agent Registration=]
to the [=Agent=] making the request.
Depending on the [=Agent Manager=], the response might immediately include
the contents of the [=Agent Registration=] itself.
